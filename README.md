# Java UI Automated Test Repository

This repository is part of CWI's UI Test Automation training. The creation was proposed for training in the use of the GItHub tool.
In this training we are using the website http://automationpractice.com/ to practice UI test automation. This repository contains the application of some tests carried out in this training.  :wink:
